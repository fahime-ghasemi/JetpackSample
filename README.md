JetpackSample

This repo demonstrates how we can use jetpack compose to build an app for showing a list and filtering the list with search feature.
Master branch uses Uni Directional Data Flow. There is a Non-UDDF branch which helps you to see how using UDDF makes the code more readable and cleaner.

I've used these technologies for creating this sample app.

- Ktor for network request
- Koin for dependency injection
- Clean architecture, meaning using data, UI and domain layers
- Jetpack compose for building UI
- Kotlin coroutines
- Kotlin flows
